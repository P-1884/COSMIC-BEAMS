COSMIC-BEAMS
------------

A Bayesian framework to infer cosmological parameters from an photometric and impure sample of strong lenses. 
The original code was taken from `zBEAMS <https://github.com/MichelleLochner/zBEAMS/tree/master>`_, though has been substantially rewritten for the strong lensing case.
